        - Minor in Mathematics
        - Worked in <a href="https://arm.eecs.umich.edu">Autonomous Robotic Manipulation Lab (ARM)</a>, supervised by prof. Dmitry Berenson and instructed by Tom Power. I developed the parameterized goal function in the Tom's normalizing flows path sampler. 
        - My graduation project is developing an autonomous writing robot using the robotics arm. The robot is voice-controlled and is capable to record the userâ€™s speaking English and write accordingly on a whiteboard with marker pen.
    - title: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Electrical and Computer Engineering
      institution: Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China
      year: 2018-2022
      description:
        - Worked in CIUS, supervised by prof. Wei Dong instructed by Gang Chen. I finished the project "An Integrated Unmanned Quadruped-Hexarotor System for Flight-Impeded Area Exploration".
        - My research at SJTU focuses on designing field robots. I gained many experiences in modeling, planning, and control. 
        - My graduation project is comparing branch predictors on a RSIV-V five-stage in-order pipeline. The whole implementation is developed in Verilog with Vivado.
