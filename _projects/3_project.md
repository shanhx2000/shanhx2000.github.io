This is a course project done at ECE552, Duke University, instructed by Prof. Lisa Wu Wills.

I was in charge of implementing the Signature-based Hit Predictor for High-
Performance Caching (SHiP), developing the platform for microbenchmark, setting up Champsim simulator, and surveying the SPEC2006 benchmark. 

In this project, (1) We survey the research area of cache replacement. Learn the basic cache replacement algorithms: LRU, LSU. . . . Learn the motivation and impor- tance (2) We implement SHiP, SDBP, and Hawkeyes, the three representative recent cache replacement algorithms. We design microbenchmarks and verify the implementations above with a simulator built on our own. (3) We did plenty of experiments with 10 different benchmarks, including single-core and multi-core configurations. (4) We analyze the results with knowledge from the course and provide possible explanations.
